# Is this project still active? - 3/24/2021

Yes! If you are looking at this project for the first time, you may notice that the commit history has been a bit sparse over the past month or so. Do not worry - I am still actively working on this project. Unfortunately, my schedule at Purdue has been extremely overwhelming since early February, and I currently have 3 separate long-term course projects & other coursework consuming nearly all of my time. As a result, I will most likely not be making any major implementation changes or version releases until the end of this semester in May. (However, if you are a contributor and submit a pull request with a change, I will review it and push it to master if everything checks out.) I plan to continue with my regular bug fixes and feature updates over the summer (and hopefully won't have this issue with my course schedule next semester since we will actually be getting breaks from school.) Thank you for your patience!

# What is Spiral?

Spiral is a program that allows users to take notes in a format similar to a spiral notebook. Unlike traditional word processors and text editors that are configured in a way that makes it difficult to document things in a non-linear fashion, Spiral pages allow users to click anywhere to start typing and easily move elements of their page around the screen. Additionally, all Spiral content is stored in plain HTML files, making it easy for users to modify their content from outside of Spiral if they wish. Spiral's UI also uses your desktop environment's system theme, so its color palette matches your system.

# Features

*  Spiral's documents are formatted like real-world spiral notebooks, which allows for information to be organized logically according to its subject matter
*  Spiral's non-linear document structure allows users to organize their thoughts naturally rather than being restricted to a linear format like word processors
*  Spiral's HTML-based document scheme allows for rich formatting
*  Spiral notebooks are auto-saved whenever changes are made
*  More to come
