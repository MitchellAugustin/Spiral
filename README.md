# What is Spiral?

Spiral is a program that allows users to take notes in a format similar to a spiral notebook. Unlike traditional word processors and text editors that are configured in a way that makes it difficult to document things in a non-linear fashion, Spiral pages allow users to click anywhere to start typing and easily move elements of their page around the screen. Additionally, all Spiral content is stored in plain HTML files, making it easy for users to modify their content from outside of Spiral if you wish. Spiral's UI also uses your desktop environment's system theme, so its color palatte matches your system.
